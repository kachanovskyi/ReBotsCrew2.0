        <p><b>Intro: </b><i>We met Fabio(CTO of Musement) at the hackathon in Mallorca on May 2016. He was one of the partners of the hackathon and was presenting their API. We really liked it and used the API to develop a chatbot which helped us to win the first prize. On the afterparty we got into talking and Fabio seemed as a really smart and pleasant to talk with person. He was really interested in chatbots, so we shared our contacts. Few weeks later, we signed our first contract with Musement - guys with a great vision and ambitions.</i></p>

        <p> Musement is a ticketing platform and travel company, which helps to enjoy the fullest experience of destinations. Recently it has raised $10 million in Series B funding. Family fund Micheli Associati, with participation from previous backers P101, and 360 Capital Partners led the round.
          Musement was founded in 2013 in Italy as the online platform for tours, activities, shows, museums, and art events.  Service at first focused in Europe and then constantly expanding to the rest of the world. Musement can work via the website, FB Messenger chatbot, iOS, and Android. The headquarters of the company is located in Milan.
        </p>
        <p>The main purpose of the company was to consolidate the tours and activities market by providing a single online destination to discover and book in-destination activities.</p>
        <img src="img/musement-645x385.jpg" alt="botcrew.com" class="img-full">
        <p>“Whether travelers want food, wine or wellness experience, access to nightlife destinations or a specialist guided tour, we wanted Musement to provide a single port of call for all their needs,” explains Musement co-founder and CEO Alessandro Petazzi.</p>
        <p>The startup provides an end-to-end ticketing service that allows travelers to receive a push notification when close to an attraction and then book a ticket, skip the line at the venue.
        </p>
        <p>“The technology pioneered by us performs real-time checks on whether a venue has same day tickets, if there is current availability and if the venue accepts e-tickets allowing travelers to maximize their time at a destination and effectively eliminating one of the tour and activity sector’s biggest growth hurdles to date,” says Petazzi.
        </p>
        <p>More recently, Musement has launched a chatbot for Messenger to help you look for things to do in a city. However, the key to these consumer experiences are partnerships the company has with major players in the travel industry.</p>
        <p>“Our bespoke end-to-end platforms that we develop specifically for travel agents, hotels, airlines and venues, have enabled us to ink deals with some of the world’s largest travel industry organizations this year including Travelport, 15below and Trekksoft,” says the Musement CEO.
        </p>
        <p>Musement plans to use the new capital to invest further in its technology, and for growth — now it operates in 450 cities across 55 countries in 7 languages. This will include additional offices to complement its HQ in Milan and recently opened Spanish office in Barcelona.
        </p>
        <p>Petazzi adds: “Our goal was also to make a seamless booking experience across all verticals, helping consumers to discover things that are relevant to them, whether at home or traveling. Until now, this integrated experience had never been achieved and our new funding round will assist us in executing this vision even further”.

            <p>Musement chatbot was built as a part of a massive project for travelers. Its primary goal is to help users find nearest exciting attractions in their area without leaving Messenger. You can discover upcoming events in your city and be redirected to the website, where you can book them in seconds.
            </p>
            <p>You can ask bot anything about your chosen city: food, drink, things to do, attractions etc. Just write a simple message like, "Suggest the best coffee in Paris" and bot will send you a list of the places to taste a cup of French coffee with croissants

            </p>
            <p>Right now BotsCrew is working on new features to improve the experience of chatting with Musement`s chatbot. As we are a team with a big passion for traveling, we work a lot to make Musement better, faster and smarter.

            <h2>What are bots?  How do they work? Why do they give a big opportunity?</h2>
            <p>In this article we are going to answer the most popular questions about chatbots. What are bots?  How do they work? Why do they give a big opportunity? Chatbot is a computer program created as a conversational agent, designed to simulate an intelligent conversation with one or more human users via auditory or textual methods. “People are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.” ...
